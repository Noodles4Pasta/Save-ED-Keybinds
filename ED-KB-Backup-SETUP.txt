1.Right click the EDKBBackup.bat file and choose edit.

On line 3 change the drive lettter to be the same as the drive the EDKBBackup.bat file is located on.	NOT THE ENTIRE FILE PATH.


FOR EXAMPLE:
          \/
set drive= K :\backup



2.Change the "Your user name" in the file path on line 7, to the name used on your computer.

You can find this in the start menu by hovering over the icon that looks like a person.

(Should be the top of the icons on the left that are just above the start icon on the taskbar)

ANOTHER EXAMPLE:
			\/	\/
%backupcmd% "C:\Users\Your User Name\AppData\Local\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous\Options\Bindings"



3.Now save and exit, and it will be ready to use!
